# Housing-Prices
This is a machine learning project that predicts house prices using different regression techniques.The model was trained using a dataset of house features, and evaluated using R2 and MSE.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model has been obtained from Kaggle, which contains information about house prices and features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage etc.

## Model Building

The model was built after using different machine learning steps,starting from data cleaning and preprocessing,feature selection,GridSearch and crossvalidation. 
Based on GridsearchCV results, a final model was selected as it gave the most efficient results.


## Evaluation Metrics

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- R2 (Coefficient of determination)
- MSE (Mean squared error)

## Conclusion

The house price prediction model achieved an R2 score of ...,  and a mean squared error of .... These metrics indicate that the model...., but it can still provide useful predictions for house prices.
